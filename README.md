Customer Segmentation Analysis

Project Overview

This project aims to perform a customer segmentation analysis for an e-commerce company. By analyzing customer behavior and purchase patterns, we aim to group customers into distinct segments. This segmentation can inform targeted marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance overall business strategies.

Data Collection

Obtain the Dataset: Make sure you have access to the dataset containing customer information and purchase history.

Example dataset sources: Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Data Exploration and Cleaning

Explore the Dataset: Understand the dataset structure and handle missing or inconsistent data.

a. Check for missing values, data types, and any inconsistencies.

b. Perform basic data exploration to get an overview of the dataset.

Clean the Data: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and ensure data consistency.

a. Drop rows with missing values and remove duplicates.

b. Ensure data types are correctly formatted.

Descriptive Statistics

Calculate Key Metrics: Compute metrics such as average purchase value and frequency of purchases.

a. Calculate the average total amount spent by customers and the frequency of their purchases.

b. Identify key metrics to understand customer behavior better.

Customer Segmentation

Apply Clustering Algorithms: Use K-means clustering to segment customers based on their behavior and purchase patterns.

a. Select relevant features for clustering, such as total amount spent, number of deals purchases, number of web purchases, and number of store purchases.

b. Apply the K-means clustering algorithm to group customers into distinct segments.

Visualization

Create Visualizations: Use visualization techniques to illustrate customer segments.

a. Create scatter plots to visualize the relationship between different features and customer segments.

b. Use color coding to represent different customer segments in the visualizations.

Insights and Recommendations

Analyze Segments: Examine the characteristics of each customer segment and provide insights and recommendations.

a. Calculate key metrics for each customer segment, such as average total spent and average number of purchases.

b. Provide tailored recommendations based on the characteristics of each segment. For example, target high-spending customers with premium products and personalized offers, and encourage low-spending customers with discounts and loyalty programs.

Learning Objectives

a. Gain practical experience with clustering algorithms.

b. Develop data cleaning and exploration skills.

c. Learn visualization techniques for conveying insights effectively.

Conclusion

This project provided a comprehensive approach to customer segmentation analysis, leveraging Python for data exploration, clustering, and visualization. The insights gained from this analysis can drive data-driven decision-making and enhance business strategies for the e-commerce company.
